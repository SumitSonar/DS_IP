# **Dataset Description: Air Quality Measurements** <br />


**Overview** <br />

This dataset contains air quality measurements collected over time. It includes various environmental variables related to air pollution, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC). The data points are organized in rows, with each row representing a specific time interval.

**Features** <br />

The dataset includes the following features (columns):- <br />

Date: The date of the measurement. <br />
Time: The time of the measurement. <br />
CO(GT): Concentration of carbon monoxide. <br />
PT08.S1(CO): Sensor response for CO. <br />
NMHC(GT): Concentration of non-methane hydrocarbons. <br />
NOx(GT): Concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx). <br />
PT08.S3(NOx): Sensor response for NOx. <br />
NO2(GT): Concentration of nitrogen dioxide. <br /> 
PT08.S4(NO2): Sensor response for NO2. <br />
PT08.S5(O3): Sensor response for ozone. <br />
<br />

**Usage** <br />

This dataset can be used for environmental analysis, pollution monitoring, and atmospheric studies. Researchers, data scientists, and policymakers can explore trends, correlations, and patterns in air quality data.
